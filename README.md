# Emotion recognition study
Analysis code for Cam-CAN emotion recognition study.

-The matlab code 'Emotion_recognition_parameter_extract.m' extracts the data, computes basic summary of accuracy and response time, fits the psychometric functions, and saves the task parameters and non-task data in a table for further analyses.
-The R code 'main_analysis_behaviour.Rmd' runs the behavioural analyses reported in the paper and generates the figures.
-The matlab code 'VBM_emotion_recognition.m' runs the Voxel-Based Morphometry analysis.
-The matlab code 'fmri_firstlevel.m' extracts functional connectivity map for the seed.
-The matlab code 'fmri_secondlevel.m' runs the second level functional connectivity analysis.
