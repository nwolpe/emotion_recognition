# Emotion recognition study
Analysis code for Cam-CAN emotion recognition study.

The matlab code 'Emotion_recognition_parameter_extract.m' extracts the data, computes basic summary of accuracy and response time, fits the psychometric functions, and saves the task parameters and non-task data in a table for further analyses.
The R code 'hexagon_task_github.Rmd' runs the analyses reported in the paper and generates the figures.
The matlab code 'VBM_emotion_recognition.m' runs the Voxel-Based Morphometry analysis.
